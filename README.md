# Client Management System

This is a simple C++ program that implements a basic client management system. The system allows users to perform operations on client records, including viewing, adding, updating, and deleting client information. The client data is stored in a text file.

## Features

- **View Client List**: Display a list of all clients.
- **Add New Client**: Add a new client to the system by providing details such as account number, pin code, name, phone, and account balance.
- **Delete Client**: Delete an existing client by providing the client's account number.
- **Update Client**: Modify the information of an existing client.
- **Find Client**: Search for a client by account number.

## File Format

The client data is stored in a text file (`data/data.txt`) where each client record is stored on a separate line. The fields in each client record are separated by the string `#//#`. The fields are:

- **Account Number**
- **Pin Code**
- **Client Name**
- **Phone Number**
- **Account Balance**

### Example Record Format:
```
12345#//#1234#//#John Doe#//#123-456-7890#//#5000.00
```

## Program Flow

1. **Main Menu**: The program starts with a main menu allowing the user to choose from several options:
   - View Client List
   - Add New Client
   - Delete Client
   - Update Client
   - Find Client
   - Exit the program

2. **Client Operations**: Depending on the user's choice, the program will either display the list of clients, prompt for input to add/update/delete a client, or search for a client by account number.
